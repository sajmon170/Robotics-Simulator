# RRSimulator
Godot simulator for a purpose of training a machine learning model for 
a 4-wheeled vehicle. It includes a procedural world generation to avoid
overfitting.

## To-do
- [ ] Finish implementing the procedural world generation
- [ ] Test the procedural generation on pre made tileset
- [ ] Make an own tileset resembling destination environment
- [ ] Create a realistic model of a 4-wheeled robot
- [ ] Add physical effects like friction etc.
- [ ] Make an API which allows moving the robot by AI model
- [ ] Add sensors to robot and make an API allowing to fetch it by AI model
